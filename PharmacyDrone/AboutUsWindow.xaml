                            This application was developed by Damian Smallwood, Brandon-Lee Blignaut
                            and Mohamed Kader as our third year project at Belgium Campus ITversity where we were 
                            supposed to demonstrate the acquired knowledge and skills through the delivery of a project,
                            in line with the exit level outcomes of the academic component of the qualification. 
                            For the delivery of the project, the student is required to work in a multi-disciplinary team, 
                            engaging with different stakeholders regularly to verify the satisfaction of the deliverable.

                            Pharmacy Drone was a solution to a problem that we saw , 
                            that the devlivery of medical supplies to rural area's proved to be quite a challenge. 
                            So we decided to try make use of the recent advancements in 
                            Drone technology to increase availiblity of medical supplies.
                            It is based around two parties , the patient and the supplier. 
                            The patient can select what medical supplies they require and then place
                            an order , the application will then use their current location to determine 
                            where the order is needed to be delievered to and then the supplier will load up the droen and send it on its way
